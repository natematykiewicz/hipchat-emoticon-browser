# hipchat-emoticon-browser

This is a simple (lame, ugly, stupid) [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) script
to provide an in-page browser for [hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/) emoticons.

This was inspired by https://github.com/henrik/hipchat-emoticons
but is updated every time you refresh the chatroom
and also shows any custom icons loaded in your account.

As always: patches welcome.
